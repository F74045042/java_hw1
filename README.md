Write a program to transfer an input string by a simplified version of Pig Latin rule.</br>
Your program should create and print out a new string with the first letter capitalized based on the input string by the rule.</br>
A simplified version of Pig Latin rule:</br>
If the first letter is vowel, only just add “ay” to the end.</br>
  Example: ava → avaay</br>
If the first letter is consonant, move the first letter to the end and append “ay”.</br>
  Example: java →avajay
